# Hello World!

This project is just a sample application for demonstrating cloud publishing. This demo was made for me to be able to assess the deployment process in various cloud environments and writing articles about it.

The application includes a front-end, a back-end and also calls third-party services to fetch data to be passed to the front-end on request.

The core functionality is displaying data from bike share feeds that are open for public consumption. Bike share feeds are usually available for most city bike rental services, so there are a lot of feeds to play with.

This application takes your chosen feed's autodiscover URL, and fetches it's data. 3 pre-configured feed are provided to test the application without the need for using your own URL.

If you do not want to download the project to test it, you can also check it out on glitch.me here:
